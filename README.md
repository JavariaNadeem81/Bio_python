## ðŸ“Š 1. Regression Analysis Project

### ðŸ“˜ File: `Regression.ipynb`

A basic regression notebook project using Python and Jupyter.  
It includes hands-on coding to understand simple regression.

### ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code  
3. Run all cells

### ðŸŒ± Learning Goals

- Practiced Python fundamentals  
- Improved Jupyter Notebook workflow  
- Used Git/GitHub for version control

## ðŸ«€ 2. Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

### ðŸ“˜ File: `heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`

### ðŸ“Œ Objective:
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on clinical features like age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, etc.

### ðŸ§© Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading** â€“ Loaded dataset using Pandas  
2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** â€“ Inspected shape, types, and handeld missing values  
3. **Preprocessing** â€“ Used `train_test_split`, scaled features with `StandardScaler`  
4. **Model Building** â€“ Trained a Logistic Regression model  
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
6. *(Optional)* Visualized model performance using heatmaps

### âœ… Result:
Achieved an accuracy of **...%** using Logistic Regression  
Helps in early detection of heart disease risk for better medical planning.

### ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:
- Try more ML models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Use cross-validation to validate performance  
- (Optional) Deploy with Streamlit or Flask
